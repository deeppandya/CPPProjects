The project folder contains Two header files, viz. Token.h,TokenDB.h
and Two cpp files viz. Token.cpp,TokenDB.cpp & the main file i.e. TokenDriver.cpp as specified in the assignment description.

Token class is the structure of a Token with fields like TokenString,TokenFrequency and linenumbers.

TokenDB class is used to create Tokens from a given file.and implemented different functions to print all tokens from TokenDB and lookup for a specific Token.

I have included test file i.e. TestFile.txt

Extra Feature : Export Data from TokenDB as "output.txt"

All of my functions are working correctly without any issues.
